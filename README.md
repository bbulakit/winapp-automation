## Project Overview

This project aims to develop functions (controllers) to automate interactions with a third-party Windows Desktop Application that consists of two main screens:

1. **Order Screen**
2. **Task Screen**

To achieve this, we use .NET decompilers and UI inspection tools to reverse engineer the application's business logic and automation identifiers. This allows us to create automated controls for interacting with the application effectively.
